Hello!


My name is Sasank. I am a founding member and AI scientist at
[Qure.ai](http://www.qure.ai). My work involves deep learning on medical
images obtained from radiology. My passion lies at the intersection of AI,
healthcare and open source technologies. As a founding member of Qure.ai, I
led and contributed to developing AI for healthcare. I am instrumental in
development of qER, a intracranial hemorrhage detection tool.

I am an avid hiker and alpine snowboarder. Mumbai is nicely nestled in Western
Ghats and there are some very good hikes nearby in Lonavla and Bhandardara. I
should have hiked some 30 summits around Mumbai. As a kid, I was not into
sports. So, I have decided to do something drastic and learn snowboarding in
Himalayas! I have snowboarded from some of the highest slopes in the world
(4000m). These days, I am getting into photography.

I contributed significantly to PyTorch, a deep learning framework used by many
organizations around the world. I also made numerous contributions to open
source and maintains an active profile on Github. Some of my contributions
include Keras, SimpleITK, Scikit-Learn libraries. My own projects on image
rectification and feature extraction are also popular.


Since my childhood, I was always interested in math. So, I picked up Electrical
Engineering as my major in IIT Bombay in 2015.  At IITB, MA 105 - Intro to
Calculus, caught my imagination with the amount of rigor and formalism possible
in math. So, I ended doing a minor in Mathematics. During my senior year, I
discovered computer vision and ended up doing lot of courses in computer science
department. Some of my favorite courses from the time:

* Computer Vision
* Information Theory
* Abstract Algebra
* Processor Design
* Signal Processing

I have strong music tastes. I love rock and classical music. I am getting into
Carnatic music these days. I really like Annammaya's songs.
[Here's](https://chsasank.github.io/music-2016q4.html) some recommendations of
music. Besides, I read a lot of classic books. I should maintain a list
somewhere, hopefully along with a short review.

You can find me at other places around the web.
