Hello!

My name is Sasank.
I work at [Qure.ai](http://www.qure.ai). 
My work involves deep learning on medical images obtained from radiology.
Yep, it's quite cool :)

I live in Mumbai, although I am from Vijayawada, Andhra Pradesh.
I did my UG here in Mumbai at Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay. 
I majored in Electrical Engineering and minored in Mathematics.
I was mainly interested in Computer Vision.

I have strong music tastes. I love rock and classical music. 
I am getting into Carnatic music these days. I really like Annammaya's songs. 

I read a lot of books, mostly classics.
I should maintain a list somewhere, hopefully along with a short review.
