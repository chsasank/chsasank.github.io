Hello!


My name is Sasank. I am a founding member and AI scientist at
[Qure.ai](http://www.qure.ai). My work involves deep learning on medical
images obtained from radiology. My passion lies at the intersection of AI,
healthcare and open source technologies. As a founding member of Qure.ai, I
led and contributed to developing AI for healthcare. I am instrumental in
development of qER, a intracranial hemorrhage detection tool.

Outside my work, I am an avid hiker, alpine snowboarder and open source
contributor. I am getting into photography these days.

I contributed significantly to PyTorch, a deep learning framework used by
many organizations around the world. I also made numerous contributions to
open source and maintains an active profile on Github. Some of my
contributions include Keras, SimpleITK, Scikit-Learn libaries. My own
projects on image rectification and feature extraction are popular.


I have been living in Mumbai since joining IIT Bombay in 2015. I majored in
Electrical Engineering, minored in Mathematics and was mainly interested in
Computer Vision.

Since my childhood, Sasank was always interested in math.
In IITB, MA 105 - Intro to Calculus, caught his imagination with the amount of rigor and formalism possible in math. 


I have strong music tastes. I love rock and classical music.
I am getting into Carnatic music these days. I really like Annammaya's songs.
[Here's](https://chsasank.github.io/music-2016q4.html) some recommendations of music.

I read a lot of books, mostly classics.
I should maintain a list somewhere, hopefully along with a short review.
