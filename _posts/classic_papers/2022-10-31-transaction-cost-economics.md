description: "The transaction cost approach to the study of economic organization regards the transaction as the basic unit of analysis and holds that an understanding of transaction cost economizing is central to the study of organizations. Applications of this approach require that transactions be dimensionalized and that alternative governance structures be described. Economizing is accomplished by assigning transactions to governance structures in a discriminating way. The approach applies both to the determination of efficient boundaries, as between firms and markets, and to the organization of internal transactions, including the design of employment relations. The approach is compared and contrasted with selected parts of the organization theory literature."
notes: "Transaction cost approach is an inter-disciplinary approach to organizations that combine economics, sociology and law. Transaction cost, economic counterpart to friction, occurs when good or service cannot be transferred between parties easily. Transaction cost is illustrated by dilemma: is it cheaper to make components yourself or buy them from market? Transaction cost arise from the fact that humans are computationally limited while motivationally complex. Transaction cost can be dimensionalized on uncertainty, frequency and asset specificity. These dimensions can be used to explain different organizational structures."

## Summary and Case Study

Note that I use the word governance cost in place of transaction cost in the summary below as it is more illuminating in the context of the case study that follows.
