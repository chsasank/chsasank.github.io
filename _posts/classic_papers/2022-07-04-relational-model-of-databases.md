## Abstract 

Future users of large data banks must be protected from having to know how the data is organized in the machine (the internal representation). A prompting service which supplies such information is not a satisfactory solution. Activities of users at terminals and most application programs should remain unaffected when the internal representation of data is changed and even when some aspects of the external representation are changed. Changes in data representation will often be needed as a result of changes in query, update, and report traffic and natural growth in the types of stored information.

Existing noninferential, formatted data systems provide users with tree-structured files or slightly more general network models of the data. In Section 1, inadequacies of these models are discussed. A model based on n-ary relations, a normal form for data base relations, and the concept of a universal data sublanguage are introduced. In Section 2, certain operations on relations (other than logical inference) are discussed and applied to the problems of redundancy and consistency in the user's model.

## 1. Relational Model and Normal Form

### 1.1. Introduction

This paper is concerned with the application of elementary relation theory to systems which provide shared access to large banks of formatted data. Except for a paper by Childs [1], the principal application of relations to data systems has been to deductive question-answering systems. Levein and Maron [2] provide numerous references to work in this area.

In contrast, the problems treated here are those of *data independence*--the independence of application programs and terminal activities from growth in data types and changes in data representation--and certain kinds of *data inconsistency* which are expected to become troublesome even in nondeductive systems.

The relational view (or model) of data described in Section 1 appears to be superior in several respects to the graph or network model [3, 4] presently in vogue for non-inferential systems. It provides a means of describing data with its natural structure only--that is, without superimposing any additional structure for machine representation purposes. Accordingly, it provides a basis for a high level data language which will yield maximal independence between programs on the one hand and machine representation and organization of data on the other.

A further advantage of the relational view is that it forms a sound basis for treating derivability, redundancy, and consistency of relations--these are discussed in Section 2. The network model, on the other hand, has spawned a number of confusions, not the least of which is mistaking the derivation of connections for the derivation of relations (see remarks in Section 2 on the "connection trap").

Finally, the relational view permits a clearer evaluation of the scope and logical limitations of present formatted data systems, and also the relative merits (from a logical standpoint) of competing representations of data within a single system. Examples of this clearer perspective are cited in various parts of this paper. Implementations of systems to support the relational model are not discussed.

### 1.2. Data Dependencies in Present Systems

The provision of data description tables in recently developed information systems represents a major advance toward the goal of data independence [5, 6, 7]. Such tables facilitate changing certain characteristics of the data representation stored in a data bank. However, the variety of data representation characteristics which can be changed *without logically impairing some application programs* is still quite limited. Further, the model of data with which users interact is still cluttered with representational properties, particularly in regard to the representation of collections of data (as opposed to individual items). Three of the principal kinds of data dependencies which still need to be removed are: ordering dependence, indexing dependence, and access path dependence. In some systems these dependencies are not clearly separable from one another.

*1.2.1. Ordering Dependence*. Elements of data in a data bank may be stored in a variety of ways, some involving no concern for ordering, some permitting each element to participate in one ordering only, others permitting each element to participate in several orderings. Let us consider those existing systems which either require or permit data elements to be stored in at least one total ordering which is closely associated with the hardware-determined ordering of addresses. For example, the records of a file concerning parts might be stored in ascending order by part serial number. Such systems normally permit application programs to assume that the order of presentation of records from such a file is identical to (or is a subordering of) the  stored ordering. Those application programs which take advantage of the stored ordering of a file are likely to fail to operate correctly if for some reason it becomes necessary to replace that ordering by a different one. Similar remarks hold for a stored ordering implemented by means of pointers.

It is unnecessary to single out any system as an example, because all the well-known information systems that are marketed today fail to make a clear distinction between order of presentation on the one hand and stored ordering on the other. Significant implementation problems must be solved to provide this kind of independence.

*1.2.2. Indexing Dependence.* In the context of formatted data, an index is usually thought of as a purely performance-oriented component of the data representation. It tends to improve response to queries and updates and, at the same time, slow down response to insertions and deletions. From an informational standpoint, an index is a redundant component of the data representation. If a system uses indices at all and if it is to perform well in an environment with changing patterns of activity on the data bank, an ability to create and destroy indices from time to time will probably be necessary. The question then arises: Can application programs and terminal activities remain invariant as indices come and go?

Present formatted data systems take widely different approaches to indexing. TDMS [7] unconditionally provides indexing on all attributes. The presently released version of IMS [5] provides the user with a choice for each file: a choice between no indexing at all (the hierarchic sequential organization) or indexing on the primary key only (the hierarchic indexed sequential organization). In neither case is the user's application logic dependent on the existence of the unconditionally provided indices. IDS [8], however, permits the file designers to select attributes to be indexed and to incorporate indices into the file structure by means of additional chains. Application programs taking advantage of the performance benefit of these indexing chains must refer to those chains by name. Such programs do not operate correctly if these chains are later removed.

*1.2.3. Access Path Dependence.* Many of the existing formatted data systems provide users with tree-structured files or slightly more general network models of the data. Application programs developed to work with these systems tend to be logically impaired if the trees or networks are changed in structure. A simple example follows.

Suppose the data bank contains information about parts and projects. For each part, the part number, part name, part description, quantity-on-hand, and quantity-on-order are recorded. For each project, the project number, project name, project description are recorded. Whenever a project makes use of a certain part, the quantity of that part committed to the given project is also recorded. Suppose that the system requires the user or file designer to declare or define the data in terms of tree structures. Then, any one of the hierarchical structures may be adopted for the information mentioned above (see Structures 1-5).

</figure>

Now, consider the problem of printing out the part number, part name, and quantity committed for every part used in the project whose project name is "alpha." The following observations may be made regardless of which available tree-oriented information system is selected to tackle this problem. If a program P is developed for this problem assuming one of the five structures above--that is, P makes no test to determine which structure is in effect--then P will fail on at least three of the remaining structures. More specifically, if P succeeds with structure 5, it will fail with all the others; if P succeeds with structure 3 or 4, it will fail with at least 1, 2, and 5; if P succeeds with 1 or 2, it will fail with at least 3, 4, and 5. The reason is simple in each case. In the absence of a test to determine which structure is in effect, P fails because an attempt is made to execute a reference to a nonexistent file (available systems treat this as an error) or no attempt is made to execute a reference to a file containing needed information. The reader who is not convinced should develop sample programs for this simple problem.

Since, in general, it is not practical to develop application programs which test for all tree structurings permitted by the system, these programs fail when a change in structure becomes necessary. Systems which provide users with a network model of the data run into similar difficulties. In both the tree and network cases, the user (or his program) is required to exploit a collection of user access paths to the data. It does not matter whether these paths are in close correspondence with pointer-defined paths in the stored representation--in IDS the correspondence is extremely simple, in TDMS it is just the opposite. The consequence, regardless of the stored representation, is that terminal activities and programs become dependent on the continued existence of the user access paths.

One solution to this is to adopt the policy that once a user access path is defined it will not be made obsolete until all application programs using that path have become obsolete. Such a policy is not practical, because the number of access paths in the total model for the community of users of a data bank would eventually become excessively large.


### 1.3. A Relational View of Data

The term *relation* is used here in its accepted mathematical sense. Given sets $S_1, S_2, \dots , S_n$ (not necessarily distinct), $R$ is a relation on these $n$ sets if it is a set of $n$-tuples each of which has its first element from $S_1$, its second element from $S_2$, and so on.<label for="sn-1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-1" class="margin-toggle"/>
<span class="sidenote">
More concisely, R is a subset of the Cartesian product $S_1 \times S_2 \times \dots \times S_n$
</span>. We shall refer to $S_j$ as the $j$th *domain* of $R$. As defined above, $R$ is said to have degree $n$. Relations of degree 1 are often called *unary*, degree 2 *binary*, degree 3 *ternary*, and degree $n$ *n-ary*.

For expository reasons, we shall frequently make use of an array representation of relations, but it must be remembered that this particular representation is not an essential part of the relational view being expounded. An array which represents an $n$-ary relation $R$ has the following properties:

1. Each row represents an $n$-tuple of $R$.
2. The ordering of rows is immaterial.
3. All rows are distinct.
4. The ordering of columns is significant--it corresponds to the ordering $S_1, S_2, \dots , S_n$ of the domains on which $R$ is defined (see, however, remarks below on domain-ordered and domain-unordered relations).
5. The significance of each column is partially conveyed by labeling it with the name of the corresponding domain.

The example in Figure 1 illustrates a relation of degree 4, called *supply*, which reflects the shipments-in-progress of parts from specified suppliers to specified projects in specified quantities.

| supply  | (supplier | part | project | quantity) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|  | 1  | 2 | 5 | 17 |

| | 2 | 3 | 7 | 9 |
| | 2 | 7 | 5 | 4 |
| | 4 | 1 | 1 | 12|


One might ask: If the columns are labeled by the name of corresponding domains, why should the ordering of columns matter? As the example in Figure 2 shows, two columns may have identical headings (indicating identical domains) but possess distinct meanings with respect to the relation. The relation depicted is called *component*. It is a ternary relation, whose first two domains are called *part* and third domain is called *quantity*. The meaning of *component* $(x, y, z)$ is that part $x$ is an immediate component (or subassembly) of part $y$, and $z$ units of part $x$ are needed to assemble one unit of part $y$. It is a relation which plays a critical role in the parts explosion problem.

It is a remarkable fact that several existing information systems (chiefly those based on tree-structured files) fail to provide data representations for relations which have two or more identical domains. The present version of IMS/360 [5] is an example of such a system.

The totality of data in a data bank may be viewed as a collection of time-varying relations. These relations are of assorted degrees. As time progresses, each $n$-ary relation may be subject to insertion of additional $n$-tuples, deletion of existing ones, and alteration of components of any of its existing $n$-tuples

In many commercial, governmental, and scientific data banks, however, some of the relations are of quite high degree (a degree of 30 is not at all uncommon). Users should not normally be burdened with remembering the domain ordering of any relation (for example, the ordering *supplier*, then *part*, then *project*, then *quantity* in the relation *supply*). Accordingly, we propose that users deal, not with relations which are domain-ordered, but with *relationships* which are their domain-unordered counterparts.<label for="sn-2" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-2" class="margin-toggle"/>
<span class="sidenote">
In mathematical terms, a relationship is an equivalence class of those relations that are equivalent under permutation of domains (see Section 2.1.1).
</span>
To accomplish this, domains must be uniquely identifiable at least within any given relation, without using position. Thus, where there are two or more identical domains, we require in each case that the domain name be qualified by a distinctive *role name*, which serves to identify the role played by that domain in the given relation. For example, in the relation *component* of Figure 2, the first domain *part* might be qualified by the role name *sub*, and the second by *super*, so that users could deal with the relationship *component* and its domains--*sub.part, super.part, quantity*--without regard to any ordering between these domains.

To sum up, it is proposed that most users should interact with a relational model of the data consisting of a collection of time-varying relationships (rather than relations). Each user need not know more about any relationship than its name together with the names of its domains (role qualified whenever necessary).<label for="sn-3" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-3" class="margin-toggle"/>
<span class="sidenote">
Naturally, as with any data put into and retrieved from a computer system, the user will normally make far more effective use of the data if he is aware of its meaning.</span> Even this information might be offered in menu style by the system (subject to security and privacy constraints) upon request by the user.

There are usually many alternative ways in which a relational model may be established for a data bank. In order to discuss a preferred way (or normal form), we must first introduce a few additional concepts (active domain, primary key, foreign key, nonsimple domain) and establish some links with terminology currently in use in information systems programming. In the remainder of this paper, we shall not bother to distinguish between relations and relationships except where it appears advantageous to be explicit. Consider an example of a data bank which includes relations concerning parts, projects, and suppliers. One relation called *part* is defined on the following domains:
1. part number
2. part name
3. part color
4. part weight
5. quantity on hand
6. quantity on order

and possibly other domains as well. Each of these domains is, in effect, a pool of values, some or all of which may be represented in the data bank at any instant. While it is conceivable that, at some instant, all part colors are present, it is unlikely that all possible part weights, part names, and part numbers are. We shall call the set of values represented at some instant the *active domain* at that instant.

Normally, one domain (or combination of domains) of a given relation has values which uniquely identify each element ($n$-tuple) of that relation. Such a domain (or combination) is called a *primary key*. In the example above, part number would be a primary key, while part color would not be. A primary key is *nonredundant* if it is either a simple domain (not a combination) or a combination such that none of the participating simple domains is superfluous in uniquely identifying each element. A relation may possess more than one nonredundant primary key. This would be the case in the example if different parts were always given distinct names. Whenever a relation has two or more nonredundant primary keys, one of them is arbitrarily selected and called *the* primary key of that relation.

A common requirement is for elements of a relation to cross-reference other elements of the same relation or elements of a different relation. Keys provide a user-oriented means (but not the only means) of expressing such cross-references. We shall call a domain (or domain combination) of relation R a *foreign key* if it is not the primary key of R but its elements are values of the primary key of some relation S (the possibility that S and R are identical is not excluded). In the relation *supply* of Figure 1, the combination of *supplier, part, project* is the primary key, while each of these three domains taken separately is a foreign key.

In previous work there has been a strong tendency to treat the data in a data bank as consisting of two parts, one part consisting of entity descriptions (for example, descriptions of suppliers) and the other part consisting of relations between the various entities or types of entities (for example, the *supply* relation). This distinction is difficult to maintain when one may have foreign keys in any relation whatsoever. In the user's relational model there appears to be no advantage to making such a distinction (there may be some advantage, however, when one applies relational concepts to machine representations of the user's set of relationships).

So far, we have discussed examples of relations which are defined on simple domains--domains whose elements are atomic (nondecomposable) values. Nonatomic values can be discussed within the relational framework. Thus, some domains may have relations as elements. These relations may, in turn, be defined on nonsimple domains, and so on. For example, one of the domains on which the relation employee is defined might be *salary history*. An element of the salary history domain is a binary relation defined on the domain *date* and the domain *salary*. The *salary history* domain is the set of all such binary relations. At any instant of time there are as many instances of the *salary history* relation in the data bank as there are employees. In contrast, there is only one instance of the *employee* relation.

The terms attribute and repeating group in present data base terminology are roughly analogous to simple domain and nonsimple domain, respectively. Much of the confusion in present terminology is due to failure to distinguish between type and instance (as in "record") and between components of a user model of the data on the one hand and their machine representation counterparts on the other hand (again, we cite "record" as an example).
