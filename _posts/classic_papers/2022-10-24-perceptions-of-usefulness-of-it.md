title: "Perceived Usefulness, Perceived Ease of Use, and User Acceptance of Information Technology"

description: "Valid measurement scales for predicting user acceptance of computers are in short supply. Most subjective measures used in practice are unvalidated, and their relationship to system usage is unknown. The present research develops and validates new scales for two specific variables, perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use, which are hypothesized to be fundamental determinants of user acceptance. Definitions for these two variables were used to develop scale items that were pretested for content validity and then tested for reliability and construct validity in two studies involving a total of 152 users and four application programs."
notes: "This paper was written in the late 80s during the adoption of foundational information technologies like email. It deals with how users perceive and accept these technologies. It is shown that *perceived* usefulness and ease of use are great predictors of usage. While usefulness is more correlated with usage, usefulness is dependent on ease of use. i.e. A technology is not useful if it is not easy to use. Therefore following causal chain is observed: perceived ease of use → perceived usefulness → usage. I have illustrated the process with a simple case study on how my mom adopted an instant-delivery platform."

I have decided to shake up the formula of classic papers by using my Samsung tablet lot more. I'll be highlighting the PDF directly and will be writing my notes on the margins. In addition, I'll also be writing my notes and possibly a case study on each of the paper. This process lets me focus on content lot more. This paper is first in that series.
