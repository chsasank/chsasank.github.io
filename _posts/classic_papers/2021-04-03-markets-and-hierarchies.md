<span class="mark">The principal purposes of this paper are to examine the factors which induce a shift of transactions from market to internal organization and, within internal organization, to explain the types of hierarchical relations that predictably emerge.</span> It is generally acknowledged that a prima facie case for the development of nonmarket (or quasi-market) forms of economic organization can be said to exist whenever the market, if used to complete a set of transactions, experiences "frictions." But this is only a rebuttable presumption. As R. Coase has emphasized repeatedly, the problems of efficient economic organization need to be examined in a comparative-institutional way (1960, pp. 17-18; 1964, p. 195). Concern with the study of market failures should thus be expanded to include "institutional failures" (of internal organizational, political, and judicial types) more generally.

As compared with the study of market failures, the analysis of the sources and consequences of internal organizational failures is at a very primitive stage of development. <span class="mark">I submit, however, that substantially the same factors that are ultimately responsible for market failures also explain failures of internal organization.</span> If this contention is correct, the study of alternative modes of economic organization can proceed in a symmetrical fashion. Rather than having to devise a separate apparatus for each organizing mode, a common language and conceptual apparatus can be brought systematically to bear across modes.

## I. Markets and Market Failures

<span class="mark">It will be argued here that the interesting problems of economic organization are mainly to be explained by reference to the conjunction of a set of human attributes with a related set of (largely nontechnological) transactional factors.</span> Inasmuch as economics is a social science concerned with exchange, this is perhaps unsurprising. Discussions of economic organization nevertheless are frequently dominated by references to technology.

To be sure, technological indivisibilities or nonseparabilities in production processes sometimes exist and have important organizational implications. Inasmuch, however, as exclusive reliance on such considerations would permit only relatively simple forms of economic organization to be explained, whereas actual firms and markets are often highly complex and subtle instruments, other (nontechnological) factors are presumably operative. To these we now turn.

### A. Human Factors

<span class="mark">But for the existence of one or more of the following three factors, there would appear to be little reason to supplant market organization with some form of nonmarket organization.</span>

**1. Bounded Rationality**

<span class="mark">Bounded rationality refers to rate and storage limits on the capacities of individuals to receive, store, retrieve, and process information without error.</span> The reasons why the absence of unlimited computational capacity prevents comprehensive contracting of the sort required for the standard theorems on the existence and optimality of a competitive equilibrium to go through have been examined by R. Radner (1968). Certain specific problems of interfirm (but, more generally, of autonomous) contracting are also examined in my discussion of vertical integration (1971, pp. 115-18).

**2. Opportunism**

<span class="mark">Opportunism is an effort to realize individual gains through a lack of candor or honesty in transactions.</span><label for="sn-1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-1" class="margin-toggle"/>
<span class="sidenote">
Returns attributable to productive advantages (e.g., a unique location or differential skill) are *not* to be regarded as opportunistic. Strategic representations are required for opportunism to obtain.</span> It can take either of two forms. The most commonly recognized is the strategic disclosure of asymmetrically distributed information by (at least some) individuals to their advantage. Original negotiations may be impaired on this account.

The second type manifests itself during contract execution and renewal. The impossibility of extracting what can be confidently regarded as self-enforcing promises to behave “responsibly” requires that agreements be monitored and may pose problems, due to first-mover advantages, at the contract renewal interval—where by a first-mover advantage I mean that winners of original bids acquire firm-specific experience which places them at a cost advantage in relation to nonwinners on subsequent rounds of negotiation (O. Williamson, 1971, p. 116). (The consequences of this are discussed further in conjunction with the small numbers issue below.)

**3. Atmosphere**

<span class="mark">Individuals are not (all) given to the strict maximization of expected pecuniary gain but also consume “atmosphere.”</span> Modes of organization or practices which would have superior productivity consequences if implemented within, and thus would be adopted by, a group of expected pecuniary gain maximizers may be modified or rejected by groups with different values. For one thing, favorable productivity consequences may no longer obtain. In addition, preferences for atmosphere may induce individuals to forego material
gains for nonpecuniary satisfactions if the modes or practices are regarded as oppressive or otherwise repugnant.


This does not lead to a uniform preference for one mode of organization over another, however. Individuals who value independence highly may favor markets over hierarchy, while others may favor internal organization because of associational satisfactions which they derive. The institutional design problem requires that requisite variety be supplied so as to permit individuals to allocate themselves appropriately among alternative modes.
