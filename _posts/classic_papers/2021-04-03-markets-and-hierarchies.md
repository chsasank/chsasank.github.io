<span class="mark">The principal purposes of this paper are to examine the factors which induce a shift of transactions from market to internal organization and, within internal organization, to explain the types of hierarchical relations that predictably emerge.</span> It is generally acknowledged that a prima facie case for the development of nonmarket (or quasi-market) forms of economic organization can be said to exist whenever the market, if used to complete a set of transactions, experiences "frictions." But this is only a rebuttable presumption. As R. Coase has emphasized repeatedly, the problems of efficient economic organization need to be examined in a comparative-institutional way (1960, pp. 17-18; 1964, p. 195). Concern with the study of market failures should thus be expanded to include "institutional failures" (of internal organizational, political, and judicial types) more generally.

As compared with the study of market failures, the analysis of the sources and consequences of internal organizational failures is at a very primitive stage of development. <span class="mark">I submit, however, that substantially the same factors that are ultimately responsible for market failures also explain failures of internal organization.</span> If this contention is correct, the study of alternative modes of economic organization can proceed in a symmetrical fashion. Rather than having to devise a separate apparatus for each organizing mode, a common language and conceptual apparatus can be brought systematically to bear across modes.

## I. Markets and Market Failures

<span class="mark">It will be argued here that the interesting problems of economic organization are mainly to be explained by reference to the conjunction of a set of human attributes with a related set of (largely nontechnological) transactional factors.</span> Inasmuch as economics is a social science concerned with exchange, this is perhaps unsurprising. Discussions of economic organization nevertheless are frequently dominated by references to technology.

To be sure, technological indivisibilities or nonseparabilities in production processes sometimes exist and have important organizational implications. Inasmuch, however, as exclusive reliance on such considerations would permit only relatively simple forms of economic organization to be explained, whereas actual firms and markets are often highly complex and subtle instruments, other (nontechnological) factors are presumably operative. To these we now turn.

### A. Human Factors

<span class="mark">But for the existence of one or more of the following three factors, there would appear to be little reason to supplant market organization with some form of nonmarket organization.</span>

**1. Bounded Rationality**

<span class="mark">Bounded rationality refers to rate and storage limits on the capacities of individuals to receive, store, retrieve, and process information without error.</span> The reasons why the absence of unlimited computational capacity prevents comprehensive contracting of the sort required for the standard theorems on the existence and optimality of a competitive equilibrium to go through have been examined by R. Radner (1968). Certain specific problems of interfirm (but, more generally, of autonomous) contracting are also examined in my discussion of vertical integration (1971, pp. 115-18).

**2. Opportunism**

<span class="mark">Opportunism is an effort to realize individual gains through a lack of candor or honesty in transactions.</span><label for="sn-1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-1" class="margin-toggle"/>
<span class="sidenote">
Returns attributable to productive advantages (e.g., a unique location or differential skill) are *not* to be regarded as opportunistic. Strategic representations are required for opportunism to obtain.</span> It can take either of two forms. The most commonly recognized is the strategic disclosure of asymmetrically distributed information by (at least some) individuals to their advantage. Original negotiations may be impaired on this account.

The second type manifests itself during contract execution and renewal. The impossibility of extracting what can be confidently regarded as self-enforcing promises to behave “responsibly” requires that agreements be monitored and may pose problems, due to first-mover advantages, at the contract renewal interval—where by a first-mover advantage I mean that winners of original bids acquire firm-specific experience which places them at a cost advantage in relation to nonwinners on subsequent rounds of negotiation (O. Williamson, 1971, p. 116). (The consequences of this are discussed further in conjunction with the small numbers issue below.)

**3. Atmosphere**

<span class="mark">Individuals are not (all) given to the strict maximization of expected pecuniary gain but also consume “atmosphere.”</span> Modes of organization or practices which would have superior productivity consequences if implemented within, and thus would be adopted by, a group of expected pecuniary gain maximizers may be modified or rejected by groups with different values. For one thing, favorable productivity consequences may no longer obtain. In addition, preferences for atmosphere may induce individuals to forego material
gains for nonpecuniary satisfactions if the modes or practices are regarded as oppressive or otherwise repugnant.


This does not lead to a uniform preference for one mode of organization over another, however. Individuals who value independence highly may favor markets over hierarchy, while others may favor internal organization because of associational satisfactions which they derive. The institutional design problem requires that requisite variety be supplied so as to permit individuals to allocate themselves appropriately among alternative modes.

### B. Transactional Factors

Whether markets experience contractual problems as a result of bounded rationality and opportunism turns on a related set of transactional factors. Thus the consequences of bounded rationality are less severe if the transactions in question are uncomplicated and experience little uncertainty. Similarly, opportunism is restricted if competition reliably obtains or if information asymmetries can be overcome at little cost.

**1. Uncertainty**

The effects of uncertainty on economic behavior are extensive and pervasive (K. Arrow, 1969, 1971; Radner, 1968, 1970). <span class="mark">Of particular interest to us here is that, inasmuch as a full set of contingent claim markets is infeasible (by reason of bounded rationality), adaptive, sequential decision-making procedures need be devised.</span> Vulnerable as market exchange is to opportunism in these circumstances, hierarchical forms of organization are apt often to be favored.

**2. Small Numbers**

If a large number of traders are roughly equally qualified to supply the good or service in question--not merely at the outset but also (inasmuch as environmental uncertainty and bounded rationality render once-for-all contracts uneconomical) at contract renewal intervals--competition will obtain, trading ranges will be narrowly restricted, and market exchange will be attractive. But while frequently a large numbers condition will seem to obtain at the outset, this may be illusory or may not continue into contract renewal stages.

The illusion is that implicit homogeneity assumptions may not be satisfied. Nonhomogeneity coupled with information impactedness and opportunism pose serious disclosure problems. Not only can markets shrink on this account, but they may vanish altogether (see G. Ackerlof).

In addition, although large numbers homogeneity conditions may obtain at the outset, this may no longer hold at the contract renewal interval. If parity among suppliers is upset by first-mover advantages, so that winners of original bids subsequently enjoy nontrivial cost advantages over nonwinners, the joining of users and suppliers under a sales relationship will predictably give rise to small numbers haggling and associated maladaptations.

The argument has relevance not only for examining when separable components will be made internally rather than purchased, but also when the work flow between successive individuals will be exchanged under an employment rather than a sales relationship. Transaction-specific human capital is not all that uncommon (P. Doeringer and M. Piore) and favors hierarchy.

**3. Information Impactedness**

<span class="mark">Information impactedness is partly an information asymmetry condition: one of the agents to a contract has deeper knowledge than does the other (Arrow 1969, p. 55). But more than asymmetry is implied by our use of the term impactedness.</span> It is also costly for the party with less information to achieve information parity. To the extent that it is difficult to distinguish between agents who disclose the impacted information to which they have access in an opportunistic (selective or distorted) manner from those who make good faith representations, agents of the latter type may be induced to withdraw from the market.

### C. An Example

Although most of the problems of markets (including public goods, externalities, markets for information (including invention), etc.) can be traced to the conjunction of the human and transactional factors described above (in that, absent these, the problems would vanish), it is beyond the scope of this paper to attempt such a showing here. Insurance, however, offers a simple illustration. Risk aversion will be assumed and the question is whether a group of individuals who are exposed to independent risks will be able to pool these successfully with an insurer.

Assume that the members of the group are uniformly distributed over the risk interval $p_1$ to $p_2$, where $p_1 < p_2$ and $p$ denotes the probability for a particular individual that the contingency to be insured will eventuate. (Since this probability will vary depending on the risk-mitigating actions taken by an individual, assume that $p$ reflects efficient risk mitigation.) Whereas individuals will be assumed to know their risk characteristics exactly, the insurer is unable, at low cost, to distinguish one member of the group from another. Information impactedness thus obtains. Assume also that the highest premium that an individual of risk class p will pay is $(p+\epsilon)D$, where $\epsilon<(p_2-p_1)/2$, and $D$ is the (common) damage that will be incurred if the contingency obtains.

In the absence of other information, and assuming transaction costs to be negligible, insurers would break even if they could sell insurance to all members of this group at a premium of $[(p_1+p_2)/2]D$, which is the mean loss. Such a premium will be regarded as excessive, however, by those risk types for whom $p+\epsilon < (p_1+p_2)/2$. Inasmuch as these preferred risks cannot easily establish that they are honestly entitled to a lower premium--since (opportunistic) poor risk types can make the same representations and insurers are unable (except at great cost) to distinguish between them---they will withdraw. Break even then requires that remaining parties be charged a higher premium; the system will stabilize eventually at a premium of $(p_2-\epsilon)D$. Information impactedness and opportunism thus result in what is commonly referred to as the "adverse selection" problem.

Moreover, the matter does not end here if the extent of the losses incurred is influenced by the degree to which insured parties take steps designed to mitigate losses. If promises were self-enforcing, insurers need merely extract a promise from insureds that, once insured, they will behave responsibly. Alternatively, if it could easily be discerned *ex post* whether efficient contingency mitigating practices had or had not been followed, insurers could supply insureds with appropriate incentives to behave responsibly by paying only those claims that fell within the terms of the agreement. If, however, such determinations can only be made at great cost and (some) insureds exploit *ex post* information impactedness opportunistically, the problem referred to in the insurance literature as "moral hazard" obtains (Arrow, 1971, pp. 142, 202, 243). Premiums will be increased on this account also. Note finally that responsible parties who otherwise would be prepared to self-enforce promises to take efficient loss mitigating actions may find that such behavior is not competitively viable and will consequently be induced to imitate opportunistic types by underinvesting in loss mitigation as well.<label for="sn-2" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-2" class="margin-toggle"/>
<span class="sidenote">
It is furthermore relevant in this connection to distinguish between insurance claims attributable to excessive exposure to hazard, for failure to take appropriate protective actions, and the "overutilization" of insured services (e.g., health care) because, given insurance, the effective price is less than the market price. M. Pauly contends that only the former and not the latter reflects moral hazard, and describes the price responsiveness as a result "not of moral perfidy, but of rational economic behavior" (p. 535). Clearly, however, behavior of both types could and would be eliminated if insurers could extract self-enforcing promises from insureds not to exploit *ex post* information impactedness opportunistically. Inasmuch as *ex post* behavior of both types is attributable to the impossibility of extracting such guarantees, it seems artificial that one type should be regarded as moral perfidy but not the other (Arrow 1971, pp. 220-21).</span>

### D. Administrative Expense

Although information asymmetries may initially be great, so that estimates of the true characteristics of economic agents are subject to considerable uncertainty, these can be reduced in a variety of ways. One is to infer true characteristics from experience. A simple performance record can be maintained and a priori probabilities successively revised. This can often usefully be supplemented by both precontract and performance auditing. Performance audits are especially important where outcomes are jointly dependent on the state of nature that obtains and the behavior of the economic agent. Arrow refers to this condition as the "confounding of risks and decisions" (1969, p. 55). Absent a performance audit, the true explanation for the outcomes observed in these circumstances cannot be accurately established.

Revising the terms of a contract to reflect the additional information gleaned from experience may be referred to as experience rating. The prospect that this will be done serves to curb opportunism in contract execution. Inferior agents will nevertheless be able to exploit information impactedness, however, unless original terms are relatively severe (i.e., no bargains are to be had on joining) or parties are unable easily to opt out when terms are adjusted adversely against them.

One way to accomplish the latter is for markets to pool their experience so that opportunistic types cannot secure better terms by "quitting" and turning elsewhere.<label for="sn-3" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-3" class="margin-toggle"/>
<span class="sidenote">
This should not be read as a rationale for anticompetitive collusion.</span> This requires that a common language be devised for describing agent characteristics, which will be greatly facilitated if the behavior in question can be easily quantified. Where instead the judgments to be made are highly subjective, the costs of communication needed to support a collective experience rating system are apt to become prohibitive. Internal organization may be favored instead because it affords economies of communication.<label for="sn-4" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-4" class="margin-toggle"/>
<span class="sidenote">
To the extent that supervisors and experience raters are one and the same individual, the need to rationalize subjective assessments that are confidently held but difficult to articulate is reduced. Thus the occasion to communicate is less. In addition, interorganizational communication on complex matters is often more costly than is intraorganizational. Full-time membership in an organization involves common training and experience as well as recurrent interpersonal contacts. Informal coding economies are realized naturally and subtle nuances come across easily as a result.</span>

## II. Internal Organization and Hierarchy

To describe the transformation of internal organization from simple peer groups through intermediate hierarchical stages to include eventually complex, adaptive organization of the sort described by S. Beer, in his cybernetic account of the enterprise, is beyond the scope of this paper. The discussion here is accordingly restricted to hierarchies of a comparatively primitive sort. The shift from peer groups to simple hierarchies, for bounded rationality and experience rating reasons, and thence to multistage hierarchies, for transactional reasons, is all that will be attempted.

Inasmuch as individuals derive nonpecuniary satisfactions from a wide variety of nonwork group affiliations, while the work group is distinguished by its productivity attributes, the discussion proceeds mainly along productivity lines. But while this delimits the inquiry, it does not imply that workers are schizophrenic with respect to their economic and noneconomic identities. Those social psychologists who have been concerned with the "human side of enterprise" have counseled against this for years. Thus, although an emphasis on productivity will be maintained, an attempt will be made to display sensitivity to the potentially oppressive consequences of alternative modes of organization by reference to on-the-job atmosphere.

### A. Peer Group Associations

So as to avoid imputing benefits to hierarchy that can be had, in some degree, by simple nonhierarchical associations of workers, it will be useful to begin with an examination of worker peer groups. These involve collective and usually cooperative activity, provide for some type of income sharing arrangement, but do not entail subordination.

**1. Advantages**

Peer group organization (possibly in the nature of a cooperative) for which loose metering has been expressly provided may arise on account of indivisibilities, for associational reasons, or because of risk-bearing advantages. Inasmuch as the rationale for shifting from individual to collective organization to reach requisite size consistent with indivisibilities is familiar, consider the associational and risk-bearing issues.<label for="sn-5" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-5" class="margin-toggle"/>
<span class="sidenote">
Indivisibilities can take either physical or informational forms. Indivisibilities of the former type are familiar. On the latter, see Radner 1970, p. 457.</span>

The associational gains of peer groups in relation to markets are attributable to the transformation of "involvement" relations (in the sense of A. Etzioni) from a calculative to a more nearly quasi-moral mode. Such an affiliation may incur productivity losses but nevertheless be valued for itself. But it may also, for pure associational reasons, yield productivity gains by mobilizing energies which, even if they could be monitored costlessly and priced accordingly, could not be exacted in the market by the assured prospect of pecuniary reward. Vulnerable, however, as loose-metering structures are to free-rider abuses, membership restrictions designed to cull out those who would exploit average group productivity are to be expected.
