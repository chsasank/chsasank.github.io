title: Guide to Semantic Segmentation with Deep Learning
author: Sasank Chilamkurthy
description: In this post, I review the literature on semantic segmentation. Most research on semantic segmentation use natural/real world image datasets. Although the results are not directly applicable to medical images, I review these papers because research on the natural images is much more mature than that of medical images.

I have written this on [Qure.ai Blog](http://blog.qure.ai/notes/semantic-segmentation-deep-learning-review). Please read this there.

>At Qure, we regularly work on segmentation and object detection problems and we were therefore interested in reviewing the current state of the art.
