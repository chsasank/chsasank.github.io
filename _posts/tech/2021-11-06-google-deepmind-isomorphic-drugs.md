Google's parent company Alphabet [just](https://www.ft.com/content/499debf2-4643-449c-83e4-20a532624bbd) [announced](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/05/isomorphic-labs-deepmind-ceo-to-lead-new-alphabet-drug-discovery-lab.html) that it has launched a new drug discovery company called [Isomorphic Labs](https://www.isomorphiclabs.com/). At the first sight, this doesn't make any sense. Why is a computer technology company taking on well-entrenched pharmaceutical companies like Pfizer and Roche? See the confidence exuded by one of the Google's executives:

> UK-registered Isomorphic Labs will use technology from its sister company DeepMind “to accelerate drug discovery, and ultimately, find cures for some of humanity’s most devastating diseases,” said Demis Hassabis, the head of DeepMind, in a blog post.

He can't be bluffing, right? Even more interestingly, Google says it'll use artificial intelligence (AI) to discover drugs to cure humanity's diseases. AI and drugs? They must be crazy now. Well, not really. Google does have a trick by its sleeve and it's called AlphaFold. It can be used to predict the shape of protein with great accuracy. So what? How does that help solve humanity's most devastating diseases? Well that's the point of this post -- I'll explain how our body *really* works, why AlphaFold is a breakthrough and finally how it can help find new drugs.

We need to start at the basics of molecular biology and DNA. We will then get to [central dogma of molecular biology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_dogma_of_molecular_biology): how DNA is 'translated' into proteins. Next, we'll see how a protein's shape allows it to do its functions. This will allow us to appreciate the discovery that is AlphaFold. Finally, we'll understand how our body is really made up of protein-protein interactions and is kind of a network, not unlike neural networks. This should help us understand why Google is getting into drug discovery business.
