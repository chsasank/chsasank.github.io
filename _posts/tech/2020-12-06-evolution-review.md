Once every few decades, almost every science goes through a revolution.[1] This revolution is either a setting up or shift of *paradigm* which we use to make sense of the facts we see around the world. We can think of this paradigm as a meta-theory that all scientific theories loosely adhere to. Examples of scientific revolutions are all around us. In physics, paradigm shifts happened many times over the centuries: Newton's laws of motion and gravity, Einstein's relativity, quantum mechanics. Plate tectonics is a revolution which created such a paradigm in the first place for geology. Ostensibly, social sciences still don't have such a paradigm yet.

Biology, the study of life, has gone through many revolutions itself. Cell theory is an obvious example. By saying all the organism are composed of cells, it changed of how people *looked* at life. Darwin's 1859 book *On the Origin of Species* sparked another such revolution on how we make sense of biological diversity around us. Many of the ideas put forward by Darwin on how evolution works were proven wrong. Mendel's laws of inheritance and population genetics clarified these ideas and started the revolution of *Neo-Darwinian Synthesis* in 1950s.

However, we're nowhere at the end of the biology and Neo-Darwinian synthesis can't make sense of all the known biological facts. There are far too many mysteries that remain. Discovery of DNA and its structure[2] brought only partial answer to some of these questions. Although we know about certain biological pathways like photosynthesis or metabolism and how DNA creates proteins that make these pathways happen, we still don't have a *holistic* picture of how a cell works! Although we know chemical concentration gradients influence how egg cells *differentiate*, we still don't know how it happens so precisely and creates *us*.

As we're speaking, I think we're going through yet another revolution in biology. We need a new meta-theory to make sense of all the facts we're uncovering as our technology gets better. View of DNA as information and troves of genomic data to support it[3], evolutionary theory of microbes[4] and integration of evolutionary and developmental biology and many other breakthroughs might be pillars of this new revolution[5]. My hypothesis is that computers will play a significant part in this revolution. My interest as an AI guy in this revolution is that it might get us closer to the solution of mind-body problem.
