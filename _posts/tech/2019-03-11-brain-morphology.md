title: "Morphology of the Brain: Changes in Ventricular and Cranial Vault Volumes in 15000 subjects with Aging and Hydrocephalus"
author:  Sasank Chilamkurthy, Pooja Rao, Georgios Maragkos, Ajith Thomas
description: This post is Part 1 of a series that uses large datasets (15,000+) coupled with deep learning segmentation methods to review and maybe re-establish what we know about normal brain anatomy and pathology. Subsequent posts will tackle intra-cranial bleeds, their typical volumes and locations across similarly sized datasets.

I have written this on [Qure.ai Blog](https://blog.qure.ai/notes/brain-morphology-changes-in-ventricular-cranial-vault-volumes-with-aging). Please read this there.
