I get a sense of Déjà vu as I read the news these days. Recent tensions between India, China and the United States harken back to cold war of 1950s and 60s. The parallels are uncanny: ideological warfare, authoritarianism vs democracy, polarizing forces on rest of the world, technology competition and so on. There are some differences of course: weaponized supply chains and trade, actual technologies being competed on and so on. But history seems to be repeating itself.

There's a good reason why past has lessons for the present. History influences culture, ideology and people and that constrains a group in terms of options they have at hand. Both advantages and disadvantages a group of people have is rooted in their historical paths. This is true as much to a society as it is to an organization.

This makes history an important area to study. It helps us predict some of the patterns we might see in the future of this new cold war. And there are many questions we need answer for. The old cold war lasted four decades. Will the new one last that long? What will be the role of different states? What are the commercial and technological implications of the cold war? How was the life under mutually assured destruction? 

In my naive opinion, relevant history to be studied are [start of the original cold war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War_(1947%E2%80%931953)), [Sino-Soviet split](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sino-Soviet_split), [fall of Soviet Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissolution_of_the_Soviet_Union) and the modern rise of China. Chinese history and culture probably deserves a study on it own, so as to be able to predict Chinese moves.

## Changing Nature of Warfare

One of the best outcomes of the cold war was the phasing out of direct confrontation between super powers. World has been remarkably peaceful since the second world war thanks to the doctrine of mutually assured destruction. Instead the super-powers resorted to proxy warfare between smaller powers and competition for technology domination. These will likely continue, but contours of warfare have significantly changed since the cold war. I see three main strands of competition: economy, cybersecurity and technology. 

*Economy*: Global economy and trade is interconnected than ever before. Almost every major power enjoys a leverage over every other country in terms of trade and supply chain. We can see this happening when China [blocked](https://www.ft.com/content/9ed5f582-423d-41c4-ba23-0441f7dee165) Australia's wine and coal exports because of a diplomatic spat over the origins of COVID-19. US and allies seem to be pressuring China by [blocking export](https://www.ft.com/content/6bdc2df6-04c0-4f10-b5b4-9169e3d1a536) of semiconductors and chips to it. China, in turn, considered [banning](https://www.ft.com/content/d3ed83f4-19bc-4d16-b510-415749c032c1) rare earth exports to hurt US defence industry.

*Technology*: Today's economy is driven by technology. Whoever controls the technology and standards controls the world. This is especially true for emerging technologies like artificial intelligence, 5G communications and clean technology. This is driving competition between the world powers. Many countries blocked Huawei or see it with suspicion from their 5G telecom hardware. First thing India did when China attacked her is to [ban](https://www.ft.com/content/08e15c26-48e0-4540-a040-1a8782e84f2e) TikTok and other Chinese apps. US is putting together [techno-alliances](https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/embracing-techno-alliances-of-the-future-101615382128995.html) to ensure its preeminence. Cold war competition has put men on the Moon -- I wonder what'll happen this time around.

*Cybersecurity*: World is increasingly run using computers and the pandemic only accelerated the digitization trend. Notwithstanding the benefits of the digitization, the trend introduces a significant vulnerability: cybersecurity and hacking. Consider this: your city's electricity distribution infrastructure which powers hospitals and other critical infrastructure is controlled by computers. What if these computers are hacked by adversarial nation and the power grid is brought down to its knees? This is precisely what seemed to have [happened](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/28/us/politics/china-india-hacking-electricity.html) in *my* city, Mumbai. China seems to have [hacked](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/06/technology/microsoft-hack-china.html) Microsoft's email service and stolen secrets and intellectual property.

First world war quickly [outdated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_during_World_War_I) napoleonic warfare and tactics and created trench warfare. Second world war accelerated this trend with aerial warfare. I think we are in a similarly new and unexplored methods of warfare.

## Why Should You Care?

Ok, this is all cool. But why should a citizen like me care? It's not as if we can change much of what is happening around us. Keeping aside knowledge for its own sake argument, let me argue from a purely utilitarian and opportunistic point of view.

Take Intel.
