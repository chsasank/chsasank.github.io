*I graduated from electrical engineering*. This is a deep founded insecurity
for me. I have worked and did research on artificial intelligence, software
engineering and computers in general for around five years now. Yet I
couldn't shake off this insecurity. It always gnaws me somewhere that I
don't know how exactly compilers, databases and operating systems work. I am
keenly aware of this lack of knowledge in these areas of computer science.

I'll explore my life in college, my work after college and what future holds
for me.

## Prelude

I have to say *how* I chose electrical engineering in the first place and
start the story at high-school. I worked hard in the school and ended up
being 28th from the top in this standardized test called IIT-JEE. Using this
*rank*, you have to compete with other students in choosing the school you
want to go to. You also have to chose your major before you joined the
school. My good scores in the test allowed me to chose whatever I want. IIT
Bombay is where all my friends are going to, so that was no brainer. But,
for some random reason, I chose electrical engineering (EE) as my major.

I joined IIT Bombay (IITB) in June 2011<label for="sn-1" class="margin-toggle

class="margin-toggle"/> <span class="sidenote"> It was a rainy day. It was
always raining those days. I recall taking a photo when I saw Sun finally
after months.</span>. In the first year at IITB, students from all the
majors go through the almost same courses. These courses tend to be math,
basic sciences, an introduction to programming, and a major specific
introduction. EE, being an exception, had two introduction courses. At the
end of the first year, based on your GPA, you'll have a chance to switch
majors. 

In the first semester, I hated  EE 101 course on power, motors and stuff and
doubted the choice of my major. In the second semester, however, I loved the
EE 111 course which was digital electronics and micro processors. In the
same semester, CS 101 -- intro to computer science took place. The professor
crammed a lot of material into that course knowing that we will not do
another CS course. I ended up hating this course because it was so
difficult! Given that I loved EE 111 and hated CS 101, I decided to stick
with EE. At the end of the semester, I had fairly high GPA to allow me to
switch to whatever major I want and I didn't use the opportunity.

You gotta give it to the course designers at EE and IITB. The philosophy
tends to be that there should only a few *core courses* that everybody must
do. Students are instead *encouraged* to do *minors* in other departments
and *honours* in the same department if you want to specialize. You can take
grad-level courses too if you meet the prerequisites and sometimes,
blessings of the professor. Core course load is kept to minimum so that you
can pursue whatever you want. In the final year, you don't have any core
courses whatsoever and you have to instead do electives -- both inside and
outside your major. 

This made sure my next three years were fairly awesome. I loved math so I did
a minor in Mathematics. I loved signal processing and communication courses
because they involved a lot of Fourier transform and math. I also discovered
information theory in our intro to probability course and ended up doing
three follow up courses. I did a course on processor design and ended up
coding up a ARM7 CPU. I did some courses on quantum physics and quantum
computing because, you guessed it, math!

At the end of my third year, my friend, [Sai Bhargav](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sai-bhargav-yalamanchi/), introduced me
to *Machine Learning*. He was doing that course at the time and I was
embarrassed to ask what the hell the course was about. Machine learning has
math and did something cool with that math -- what not to like! And turns
out, I did all the basic courses to start a career in ML -- probability,
information theory, linear algebra etc. My internship also made it clear
that EE research is not for me. It started becoming clear that machine
learning is my future.

While at IITB, I always wanted to go to grad school and do a PhD. You
usually apply for grad school after your third year. I want to do a PhD in
CS department on machine learning or computer vision. The competition for ML
PhD was quite high even in those days. And look at me: an EE guy with no
course work either on basic computer science or machine learning trying to
apply to ML PhD. All my research work so far has been on signal processing
and optical fibers.

EE guys, in their wisdom, considered CS courses as 

Renaissance man.
