## Search engine optimization

I've got to write somewhere and that turns out to be this blog. But my blog is certainly not in a great shape. It doesn't show up high enough in Google and links don't get unfurled well. So gotta make it better.

People use best practices/techniques called search engine optimization aka SEO to make their website more visible. Idea is to help search engines like Google (i.e AI) find your website better. In the rest of this post, I document the process I followed to improve the SEO for my blog.

First things first - gotta know where to improve. A quick google search led me to this website called [Sitechecker](https://sitechecker.pro). I have put in my blog's url and after a minute or two, I got this report. I started to look at issues and fixing them one by one.

    Apparently my website is not so bad.

Things I fixed:

* My pagination implementation has made titles of all the pages the same. Apparently, this is not cool. Fixed them in `head.html`.
* Added lot of meta tags to help search engines know my website.
* Added twitter meta tags to enable nice card view on twitter.
