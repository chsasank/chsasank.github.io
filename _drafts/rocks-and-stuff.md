I have been reading up geology textbooks and found them super interesting ever since. I'm currently reading Essentials of Oceanography by Tom Garrison.

### Why Geology?

Do you enjoy beautiful landscapes? Have you ever been inspired by green rain forests, snow clad mountains, blue oceanside scenery or hot deserts? Have you wondered how and when did those things form?

Here's a pic I have taken at [Bhira dam](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Bhira,+Patnus,+Maharashtra+402308/@18.4603504,73.3871827,16.02z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x3be81f445b1f8c23:0xd0c5601332018f63!8m2!3d18.4565845!4d73.3880373), some 150 km from Mumbai.

The lake in the picture is reservoir from the dam. So, it is probably very recent, less than 100 years old. How about the mountains surrounding the lake? These mountains, part of [Western Ghats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Ghats#Geology) range formed some 150 million years ago! These mountains that you see are solidified lava flows produced by [massive volcanic explosion(s)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deccan_Traps). These explosions were not like your average volcano explosion; they were so huge that they are hypothesized to be one of the reasons for extinction of dinosaurs.
